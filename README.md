## Audio Reactive Light (Mic Input)

A tiny Unreal Engine demo where the player speaks into the microphone and an in‑game light reacts in real time. 
This showcases player input integration (voice/mic) and basic audio analysis for gameplay feedback, useful as a building block for stealth mechanics (e.g., speaking too loudly brightens a light or raises an alert meter).

## Why this exists

- Demonstrate that I can capture live microphone input and drive gameplay parameters from audio.
- Provide a reusable pattern for stealth games where player speech affects exposure or noise systems.
- Keep the scope small and shippable as a portfolio mini demo.

## Stealth Use Cases

- If the player talks too loudly, increase light intensity (more visible) or raise a Noise/Alert signal.   
- Whispering keeps light dim; shouting saturates it and triggers alerts.


## Privacy & Safety

- Mic is used only locally for real‑time analysis, no audio is recorded or uploaded in this demo.
